## How It Works
### **Background Script**
The `background.js` file listens for messages from the content script and handles the following:
1. Checks the status of URLs by making `HEAD` requests.
2. Manages session storage using Chrome's `chrome.storage.session` to log broken and locked links.
3. Clears session data when required.

---

### **Content Script**
The `content.js` file is injected into web pages and:
1. Iterates over all `<a>` elements (`links`) on a page.
2. Sends each link URL to the background script for validation.
3. Highlights links on the DOM:
   - `‚úÖ` Healthy links are marked with a checkmark.
   - `‚ùå` Dead links are marked with an "X" and a red border.
   - `üîí` Locked links are marked with a lock icon and a blue border.

---

### **Popup Interface**
The `popup.html` and `popup.js` files handle:
1. Displaying session data that categorizes broken/locked links by their source URL.
2. Clearing session data based on user interaction.
